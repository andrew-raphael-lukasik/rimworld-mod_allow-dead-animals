	<description>Simple mod that auto-allows freshly killed animals for butchering.

Made for people tired of constantly manually looking around for animals killed by wild predators to steal their meal.



Source code:
	https://github.com/andrew-raphael-lukasik/rimworld-mod_allow-dead-animals

Known issues:
	- Mod filters corpses by race property "Animal" so some undesirable ones may fit this cathegory, for example, insectoids are considered animals for some reason.
	- Mod doesn't recognize corpses forbidden manually by player and will re-allow them.
	- No option to turn it off mid-game (but it's 100% safe to remove it from mod list at any time).
